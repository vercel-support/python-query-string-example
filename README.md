# Python

In this example we will be deploying a simple "Hello World" example with Python.

### Getting started with Python

- Create a `index.py` file with the following code:

```python
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):

    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/plain')
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(str("Hello from Python on Now 2.0!").encode())
        return
```

### Deploy with Now

First we need to create a `now.json` configuration file to instruct Now how to build the project.

For this example we will be using our newest version [Now 2.0](https://zeit.co/now).

By adding the `version` key to the `now.json` file, we can specify which Now Platform version to use.

We also need to define each builders we would like to use. [Builders](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/builders/overview/) are modules that take a deployment's source and return an output, consisting of [either static files or dynamic Lambdas](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/builds/#sources-and-outputs).

In this case we are going to use `@now/python` to build and deploy the all Python files. We will also define a name for our project (optional).

```json
{
    "version": 2,
    "name": "python",
    "builds": [
        { "src": "*.py", "use": "@now/python" }
    ]
}
```

Visit our [documentation](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/configuration) for more information on the `now.json` configuration file.

We are now ready to deploy the app.
